## **About the Project** 

---

This project presents the results of my undergraduate physics research.
The study focuses on the synthesis of Graphene Oxide/ZnO to analyze the crystal structure, particle size, absorbance level, and bandgap energy of the synthesized material.
The main objective is to understand how the combination of Graphene Oxide and ZnO affects the optical properties and structural characteristics of the material.

Data analysis was performed using several software tools, including X’Pert HighScore Plus, Origin, ImageJ, and PowDLL, to comprehensively process and interpret the characterization results of the material.
